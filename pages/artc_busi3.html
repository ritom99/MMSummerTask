    <p>On one hand, we are seeing exits of foreign partners from the domestic mutual fund industry while on the other hand, a set of global players still find the Indian mutual fund industry attractive.</p>

    <p>On Thursday, Union Bank of India said that Japan's financial major Dai-ichi Life Holdings has acquired 39.62 percent stake in Union Asset Management Co Ltd through investment in compulsorily convertible preference shares.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, Union Mutual Fund will now be co-sponsored by Union Bank of India and Dai-ichi Life, the release said.</p>

    <p>Dai-ichi has replaced Belgium-based KBC Participations Renta SA, which exited the venture by selling its 49 percent stake in erstwhile Union KBC Asset Management Co Pvt Ltd and Union KBC Trustee Co Pvt Ltd to Union Bank of India on Sep 20.</p>

    <p>The entry of the Japanese fund with deep pockets will not only raise the prospects of Union Mutual Fund, but also accelerate the competition in an industry which is growing at 26 percent a year.</p>

    <p>Another global asset manager, BlackRock, which exited AMC joint venture with DSP in India, is said to be keen on continuing its presence in the Indian AMC business.</p>

    <p>According to reports, BlackRock has bid for acquiring IDFC AMC which is up for sale. So as the Indian mutual fund industry moves up the maturity curve, assets under management maintain the growth momentum clocking a CAGR of 26 percent global players are finding the industry appealing. The 43-player domestic mutual fund industry manages assets worth Rs 23 lakh crore as on March-end.</p>

    <p>Japan's Nippon owns a stake in Reliance Asset Management which is listed on the stock exchanges. Global players like Prudential and Franklin Templeton dominate the industry.</p>

    <p>Global investors across the board are of the view that the Indian economy is poised for significant growth.</p>

    <p>However, in the past, some of the foreign MFs that have bid adieu to India include Morgan Stanley, PineBridge, ING, and Fidelity.</p>

    <p>The main reason why few foreign MFs find India a difficult market to operate in is because they are unable to scale up their asset base. Even when some of these players manage to build a substantial equity asset base, the high cost of operations eats into profitability.</p>

    <p>Mutual fund experts said that a majority of foreign fund houses that were unable to comprehend Indian dynamics. Also, stringent guidelines by Indian regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is also making it tougher for asset managers to charge high fees. A few years ago it banned entry loads, preventing funds from charging a fee to investors buying into schemes.</p>
