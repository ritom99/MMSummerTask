		<p>It was getting late in Tomato Town. The storm was closing in, and meteors pelted the ground. Gizzard Lizard had made his way there after plundering the sparsely populated barns and domiciles of Anarchy Acres, then by avoiding the Wailing Woods and keeping the storm just off to his left. He spied an enemy combatant on high ground, who appeared to have a sniper’s rifle. In a hollow below the sniper’s perch was an abandoned pizzeria, with a giant rotating sign in the shape of a tomato. Gizzard Lizard, who had quickly built himself a redoubt of salvaged beams, said, “I think I’m going to attack. That’s one of my main issues: I need to start being more aggressive.” He ran out into the open, pausing before a thick shrub. “This is actually a really good bush. I could bush-camp. But naw, that’s what noobs do.”</p>

<p>Two men enter, one man leaves: the fighters closed in on each other. In the video game Fortnite Battle Royale, the late-game phase is typically the most frenetic and exciting. Suddenly, the sniper launched himself into a nearby field and began attacking. Gizzard Lizard hastily threw up another port-a-fort, amid a hail of enemy fire. The goal is always to get, or make, the high ground.</p>

<p>A moment later, Gizzard Lizard was dead—killed by a grenade. Afterward, he replayed the ending, from various vantages, to analyze what had gone wrong. To be so close to winning and yet come up short—it was frustrating and tantalizing. One wants to go again. The urge is strong. But it was time for my son to do his homework.</p>

<p>I spent more time as a kid than I care to remember watching other kids play video games. Space Invaders, Asteroids, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong. Usually, my friends, over my objections, preferred this to playing ball—or to other popular, if less edifying, neighborhood pursuits, such as tearing hood ornaments off parked cars. Every so often, I played, too, but I was a spaz. Insert quarter, game over. Once gaming moved into dorms and apartments—Nintendo, Sega—I learned that I could just leave. But sometimes I didn’t. I admired the feat of divided attention, the knack that some guys (and it was always guys) seemed to have for staying alive, both in the game and in the battle of wits on the couch, as though they were both playing a sport and doing “SportsCenter” at the same time.</p>

<p>Fortnite, for anyone not a teen-ager or a parent or educator of teens, is the third-person shooter game that has taken over the hearts and minds—and the time, both discretionary and otherwise—of adolescent and collegiate America. Released last September, it is right now by many measures the most popular video game in the world. At times, there have been more than three million people playing it at once. It has been downloaded an estimated sixty million times. (The game, available on PC, Mac, Xbox, PS4, and mobile devices, is—crucially—free, but many players pay for additional, cosmetic features, including costumes known as “skins.”) In terms of fervor, compulsive behavior, and parental noncomprehension, the Fortnite craze has elements of Beatlemania, the opioid crisis, and the ingestion of Tide Pods. Parents speak of it as an addiction and swap tales of plunging grades and brazen screen-time abuse: under the desk at school, at a memorial service, in the bathroom at 4 a.m. They beg one another for solutions. A friend sent me a video he’d taken one afternoon while trying to stop his son from playing; there was a time when repeatedly calling one’s father a fucking asshole would have led to big trouble in Tomato Town. In our household, the big threat is gamer rehab in South Korea.</p>

<p>Game fads come and go: Rubik’s Cube, Dungeons & Dragons, Angry Birds, Minecraft, Clash of Clans, Pokémon Go. What people seem to agree on, whether they’re seasoned gamers or dorky dads, is that there’s something new emerging around Fortnite, a kind of mass social gathering, open to a much wider array of people than the games that came before. Its relative lack of wickedness—it seems to be mostly free of the misogyny and racism that afflict many other games and gaming communities—makes it more palatable to a broader audience, and this appeal both ameliorates and augments its addictive power. (The game, in its basic mode, randomly assigns players’ skins, which can be of any gender or race.) Widespread anecdotal evidence suggests that girls are playing in vast numbers, both with and without boys. There are, and probably ever shall be, some gamer geeks who gripe at such newcomers, just as they gripe when there are no newcomers at all.</p>

<p>Shall I explain the game? I have to, I’m afraid, even though describing video games is a little like recounting dreams. A hundred players are dropped onto an island—from a flying school bus—and fight one another to the death. The winner is the last one standing. (You can pair up or form a squad, too.) This is what is meant by Battle Royale. (The original version of Fortnite, introduced last July, for forty dollars, wasn’t fight to the death; it is the new iteration that has caught fire.) A storm encroaches, gradually forcing combatants into an ever-shrinking area, where they must kill or be killed. Along the way, you seek out caches of weapons, armor, and healables, while also collecting building materials by breaking down existing structures. Hasty fabrication (of ramps, forts, and towers) is an essential aspect of the game, and this is why it is commonly described as a cross between Minecraft and the Hunger Games—and why aggrieved parents are able to tell themselves that it is constructive.</p>

<p>Before a game begins, you wander around in a kind of purgatorial bus depot-cum-airfield waiting until the next hundred have assembled for an airdrop. This is a strange place. Players shoot inconsequentially at one another and pull dance moves, like actors walking aimlessly around backstage practicing their lines. Then come the airlift and the drifting descent, via glider, to the battleground, with a gentle whooshing sound that is to the Fortnite addict what the flick of a Bic is to a smoker. You can land in one of twenty-one areas on the island, each with a cutesy alliterative name, some suggestive of mid-century gay bars: Shifty Shafts, Moisty Mire, Lonely Lodge, Greasy Grove. In patois and in mood, the game manages to be both dystopian and comic, dark and light. It can be alarming, if you’re not accustomed to such things or are attuned to the news, to hear your darlings shouting so merrily about head shots and snipes. But there’s no blood or gore. The violence is cartoonish, at least relative to, say, Halo or Grand Theft Auto. Such are the consolations.</p>

<p>Players, young ones anyway, don’t seem to notice such things. They’re after assault rifles (preferably the Legendary scar), pump shotguns, bolt-action sniper rifles (the scope is a boon), chug jugs, slurp juices, bandages, medkits, and shield potions. They see, and covet, skins that look cool but have no bearing on game play; for twenty bucks, you can don the Leviathan or the Raven. Or they fixate on dance moves, the so-called victory emotes you can have your avatar perform, in the heat of battle or after a kill. The Floss, the Fresh, the Squat Kick, the Wiggle—these have spilled out into the world. You may notice people around you, or professional athletes on TV, breaking into strange dances. The one known as Take the L is big these days in the Bundesliga and at Minute Maid Park.</p>

<p>“Think of Fortnite as a visual form of media,” Jamin Warren, the editor of the culture-and-gaming journal Kill Screen, told me. Whatever Fortnite’s allure as a game to play, it is also apparently the most beguiling one to watch. As video-game spectatorship fills arenas, and siphons a generation away from actual sports, Fortnite has become the most viewed game on YouTube—by March, there had been almost three billion views of the millions of sessions that players had uploaded—and the top game on Twitch, the streaming platform. Watching isn’t just for spazzes anymore. “It’s created a kind of global arcade,” Warren said. “Instead of a few kids looking over the shoulder of the hot-shot older brother or whatever, down at the mall, you have millions of people watching, and the person playing the game is a millionaire.”</p>

<p>The medium’s breakout star is known as Ninja. He is a former professional Halo player named Tyler Blevins, who has said that he makes more than half a million dollars a month by streaming his Fortnite sessions, and his free-associative commentary, on Twitch (which is owned by Amazon). His YouTube channel has more than ten million subscribers. Last month, he hosted a Fortnite tournament in Las Vegas, in an e-sports arena, and almost seven hundred thousand people tuned in to his Twitch stream. I’ve heard many teens refer to him as America’s biggest entertainer—which is not as hyperbolic as it sounds. In April, Ninja ranked higher than any athlete in the world in “social interactions,” a measure of social-media likes, comments, shares, and views. Cristiano Ronaldo was No. 2. In March, Ninja consented to a Fortnite session with Drake.</p>

<p>As the last hours of Season 3 expired, players scrambled to reach Tier 100, and get their John Wick skins. Gizzard Lizard was nowhere close. He’d started the season as a noob. Come the next morning, Day One of Season 4, he had a plan to put in the hours to get to Tier 100. It would take serious commitment. For the first time, he purchased a thousand Fortnite V-bucks, for $9.99, with which to buy skins. He went with the Carbide, a sleek one that brought to mind a wetsuit. This was the first time he—or, more to the point, his parents—had ever spent anything but quarters on a game.</p>
